Hi ðŸ‘‹
My name is ahmed yasin.
I'm a full-stack developer.
I have amazing experience with developing python applications to scale and integrate on different systems. 

I'm doing bachelors sciences in computer science from the virtual University of Pakistan. 

I'm a good learner and devoted python developer who goes the extra mile to get things done. 

I was awarded many hats of a full-stack developer. 

I didn't limited myself to just one stack.

In backend programming, I use Django, Python, and Django rest-framework.

On the frontend prospector, I use languages like HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, and frameworks like Jquery and react.Js

I have also designed large data sets like Postgres, MySQL work branch, and My SQL lite. 

I have good exposure to rest API designs for security So, I know my way around SSL and Tokens like Auth_tokens, CSRF - tokens, Json web tokens...

My projects are based on ALM focusing on requirements then planning, implementing code, and so on...

I have completed dozens of projects and five of them were challenging which made me learn more technologies like Webpack, Babel, web3, WebSockets, and so on...

Two of them I developed with a team where I understand the importance of team and teamwork.  I was leading a  team of 4 including me. One of them was a designer, and then tester, and then the content writer.

Our supervision was coding, analysis, and unit testing. 

As I mentioned I'm a good learner, I learned Django in 1 month and then next month I develop a website with Django for my client.
At that stage, I was a complete beginner at coding. 

My strongest skills are Django python, HTML CSS, WebSockets, Javascript, Postgresql, MySQL, bootstrap, Django rest-framework, Djoser, Pillow, Ajax. 

Currently, I'm a beginner with react, so that I'm developing web applications for learning purposes where I'm using many new. technologies like web RTC and Radies. It will enhance my skills. 

In my free time, I write blogs, stories, and articles on medium. 

I also make videos for YouTube. 
I like football and chess. 
Last but not least I have a great interest in artificial intelligence. 
I'm willing to learn new things special related to my interest like AI. 

I would like to work with a company that doesn't just challenge my technical skills but also provides me with attractive career opportunities. 

Thank you for your time....
